Tuesday October 23, 2018 - 630 - 830pm<br/>
R.House, Remington, Baltimore MD<br/>
[39.321832, -76.622120](https://www.openstreetmap.org/search?query=301%20W%2029th%20St%2C%20Baltimore%2C%20MD%2021211%2C%20USA#map=19/39.32167/-76.62214)

Goal of the meeting was to discuss plans for a Maptime event around National GIS Day on Wednesday November 14th.  A lot of great ideas were shared.

The plan moving forward is to identify a few projects and project owners and try to use a November GIS day event as a the kick-off for several smaller sub projects.

## Additional resources
- Check out the [QGIS Users Group](https://twitter.com/qgismd) which is planning on having its next meetup December 1
- [Fearless](https://twitter.com/fearlessbmore) continues to offer support for the meetup, including for our [meetup.com](https://www.meetup.com/maptime_bmore/) costs and future support for pizza and other supplies.  Thanks purple cows!
- A new member and Baltimorean mentioned the [DataHaven New Haven Community Wellbeing Survey](http://www.ctdatahaven.org/reports/datahaven-community-wellbeing-survey) they had worked on.
- UMBC Geography will be hosting a Critical Mapping Conference April 1 & 2, 2019.
- UMBC Geography profs offered that there GIS students are frequently in need of internships and can provide valuable technical skill and passion.

### Meeting space
Meeting space is always going to be a challenge, several group members shared ideas:

- Maptimers can provide access to meeting spaces and computer labs at UMBC, UB, at other University spaces around Lexington Market, and at Impact Hub.
- One Maptimer has a connection with several Baltimore based engineering firms who could provide meeting space in the City and out in the County.

## Project ideas
Some of these project ideas are more fleshed out than others, but here is a the big list of everything mentioned:

- Hosting a skills based mapping event that is focused more on learning and education
- Community Asset Mapping - e.g., ongoing efforts by BNIA to work with the Penn-North Community Arts District
- Does the Museum of Art have any mapping needs?
- Local rock climbing guidebook / map
- Applying computer vision and machine learning to [OpenStreetCam](https://openstreetcam.org/) for mapping vacants, and collecting OpenStreetCam images.

### Projects about vacant properties in Baltimore
Always a popular subject around socially-minded map and data nerds in Baltimore, lots of ideas flew around about datasets, resources, and ideas about vacants:

- BNIA has a number of ongoing projects and data layers around vacancy and is always a great resource
- Other organizations like Visit Baltimore and JHU have done other studies, tools, analyses around understanding patterns of vacants
- Other cities have looked at mapping properties in different ways to try to come up with new insights, this might include: mapping by amount due in taxes, mapping out who owns multiple properties that are vacant / unoccupied, tracking tax liens, back taxes, and permits.
- Reach out to the Community Land Trust and United Workers for additional ideas, information, data.
- Access MD Real Property data for information on taxes, sales, etc.
- Access 311 data to plot types of calls, response rates.


## Other ideas and notes
- Mobile collection devices / systems for data entry of health data in the field.  Check out [OpenDataKit](https://github.com/opendatakit) for data collection aps.
- It would be great to have a GIS Data Day to go along with the annual BNIA Data Day next summer.
- Groups like United Workers and Community Land Trust might be a great resource for helping to identify information on properties, vacancies, sales, etc.

- QGIS has streetview plugins
