Goal of the meeting was to discuss plans for a Maptime event around National GIS Day on Wednesday November 14th.  A lot of great ideas were shared. 

The plan moving forward is to identify a few projects and project owners and try to use a November GIS day event as a the kick-off for several smaller sub projects.
